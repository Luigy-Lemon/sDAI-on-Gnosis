# Savings xDAI

A tokenized wrapper of the Interest collected from Token Bridge deposits in sDAI. Supports ERC4626. Share to asset conversions are real-time even if the pot hasn't been dripped in a while. Please note this is sample code only and there is no official deploys. Feel free to deploy it yourself.

# xDAI Streaming
xDAI is moved into the sxDAI vault contract using a continuous slow drip from InterestStreamer to avoid abuse of JIT or similar arbitrage methods.
